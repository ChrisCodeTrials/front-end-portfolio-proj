                    <h2>Who and Why</h2> 
                    <p>
                        My name is <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/c-miranda1" target="_blank"><strong class="chris">Chris Miranda</strong></a>, I created this app because I have always had a passion for films. As a child, my father would take me to the movies if our days off aligned and it left an impression on me that I carry to this day. Although I love movies I often struggle choosing what I want to watch, so I figured make an application that can do the thinking for me.

                    <p>
                        Our app lets you search for movies by their genre and ratings (given by regular viewers not critics). The site automatically populates to recommend a random selection of movies while replacing them once you fill the search terms. If you want to view more with your current filters (or none), you can click the "Find More Movies" button to do so.
