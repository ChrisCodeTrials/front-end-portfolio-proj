# Planning

 **change from a movie-selling website, to movie recommendation site** 

- go over the lab again to see what the essential functionality should be
    - watch the past presentations over again to get a real grasp of the concepts for the project
- Create a wireframe to see how I will organize the website
- get started on the HTML and CSS
- sample simple JS to see how the api is displayed on my website
    - structure how I will use the api
        - the user will be able to select a genre, then on the next screen choose a year(or range of years), and finally  
    - if it works well, how can I apply the user stories to functions of my website?
